Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. | Martin Fowler
The best thing about a boolean is even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit. | Unknown
Programming is like telling a dumb but very strong person what to do. | Eugene W. Chisnell
There are two ways to write error-free code: Use a language that has no goto statements. Be very, very careful. | Brian Kernighan
When debugging, the first 90% of the effort is locating the bug and the other 10% is fixing it. | Thomas C. Ogilvie
Software is like entropy: it inevitably increases over time. | Norman Shapiro
Before software can be reusable, it first has to be usable. | Ralph Johnson
In theory, there are no differences between theory and practice. But in practice, there are. | Jan L. A. de Bakker
There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't. | Unknown
Without requirements clarification, a programmer is like a painter without a brush. | Edward Yourdon
The most important property of a program is that it works. | Edsger W. Dijkstra
Eighty percent of the code is there to deal with the other twenty percent. | Yogeshwaran Krishnan
We can safely predict that future languages will be more concise, less ambiguous, and more powerful. | Marvin Minsky
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. | Edsger W. Dijkstra
Kent Beck once said: 'The best way to get a good answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.' | Eric Sink
Programming is a process of turning caffeine into code. | Bobby Lewandowski
There’s no such thing as an object-oriented toaster. At least, not yet. | Grady Booch
The more you know about a user, the less you need to test. | Edward Yourdon
Left to themselves, programs will tend to spread out and become complex. | Mel Coad
Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. | John Woods
Writing clean code takes time and effort, but sloppy code takes forever to maintain. | Robert C. Martin
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring progress on construction by the number of bricks. | Bill Gates
Optimism is the mental attitude of a programmer who mistakenly thinks that this time, the compiler won't find any errors. | Laurence J. Peter
The function of good code is to do what it’s supposed to do. The function of good documentation is to explain what you did and why you did it. | Chris Landers
The best way to get a project finished on time is to start a year before anyone else knows you're doing it. | Anonymous
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a magic trick. | Arthur C. Clarke
Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing code. Therefore, if you write code with care, you can quite easily triple your time spent debugging. | Brian Kernighan
Premature optimization is the root of all evil (at least premature optimization by novices). | Donald E. Knuth
The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought. | Warren Buffett
A user interface so attractive it will make you cry, even if it only knows how to print Hello, World. | Bjarne Stroustrup
